# Deep-Learning-TensorFlow-Specialization-
[TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice?)


It is four-course Specialization. 


**1) Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning**

**2) Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow**
      
> developing an understanding of how to build and train neural networks. Improve a network’s performance using convolutions as you          train it to identify real-world images. 

**3) Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow**4) 

**4) Sequences, Time Series and Prediction**
      
> teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems. Learn to process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. You’ll even train an AI to create original poetry!
